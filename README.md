<b> Predict Diabetes in Logistic Regression using R </b> </br>
The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that would predict the likelihood of diabetes. 
The dataset was collected and publicly shared by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases”.
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. We will start the analysis from basic
data cleaning steps such as looking for missing values, duplicate records and identifying for outliers in each covariate.
